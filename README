gmecol is a temporary name, and likely to change.

This project's intention is to be a place where people can build their game catalog, and interacting with the catalog of other's. Hopefully it can be a place where people can find others to trade rare games with, play old games together, and so on. Just starting on it, hopefully a lot more to come.
